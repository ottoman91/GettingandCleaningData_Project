# GettingandCleaningData_Project
The Repo for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. Part of the Data Scienc Track being offered by the John Hopkins University on Coursera
<h2> Instructions for the Project </h2> 
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
<ol>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. </li>
<li>From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ol>

<h3> Instructions for running the R script</h3>
<ol>
<li> Download the script in your R directory.</li>
<li> The directory should have a folder which by the name of UCI HAR Dataset, which contains the data required</li>
<li>Run the script for getting the results required.</li>
<li> Th tidy dataset is displayed in a .txt file created in the working directory by the name of tidy_data.txt
</ol>
